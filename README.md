# 42 School Solo Projects Showcase

Welcome to my repository showcasing solo projects completed during my time at 42 School. Each project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a programmer and demonstrates my skills and understanding of various programming concepts.

## Project List

Here are the solo projects included in this repository:

1. **Libft**:
   - A custom C library containing essential functions, providing a foundation for future projects.

2. **Minitalk**:
   - A communication program using signals between a client and a server, demonstrating inter-process communication (IPC) skills.

3. **Fract'ol**:
   - An exploration of fractals using a graphical library, offering visually stunning and interactive fractal representations.

4. **ft_printf**:
   - A custom implementation of the `printf` function in C, demonstrating an understanding of variadic functions and string formatting.

5. **Get Next Line (GNL)**:
   - A function that reads and returns lines from a file descriptor, allowing reading from files line by line.

6. **Push_swap**:
